# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this challenge was to create a ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type, and a multi-line chart of total fares by city type using the ptber_data_df DataFrame. 
### Deliverable 1: Ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type:
In order to create this DataFrame I had to create multiple data series using the groupby() function to identify city type as the index to find the total rides for each city type, total drivers, total fare amounts, and average fare per ride.  To find the total rides for each city type I applied the count() method to the "ride_id" column.  To find the total drivers and total fare amounts I applied the sum() method to the "driver_count" and "fare" columns.  To find the average fare per ride I applied the mean() method to the "fare" column. I then calculate the average fare per driver by city type by dividing total_fares_by_city by total_drivers_by_city_type.  Then I created the summary DataFrame pyber_summary_df by adding each of those data series to the new DataFrame.  Using code already given in the starter code, the index name was deleted. Lastly, I formatted the columns to use commas for values over 1,000 and to add a dollar sign and 2 decimal point format for dollar amounts.
### Deliverable 2: Create a multiple line plot chart of total fares by city type. 
First, I created a new DataFrame with multiple indices by using the groupby() function on the "type" and "date" columns of the pyber_data_df DataFrame.  I applied the sum() method on the "fare" column to show the sum of the fares by "type" and "date".  I then ran previously added code again to reset the index in order to later use the pivot() function.  I then needed to create a pivot table with "date" as the index, and set columns equal to "type" and values equal to "fares".  Then I created a new DataFrame from this pivot table using loc to specify the dates between '2019-01-01' and '2019-04-28'.  I then added code to set the "date" index to the datetime datatype in order to use the resample() function by week 'W' to get the weekly fare totals.  After completing those steps I was able to plot the multi-line chart using the resample DataFrame by using matplotlib and the object-oriented interface method.     
## Results
Upon completing this analysis, it became very clear that there is much more ride-share activity in the urban areas.  Of the 3 types of cities, Urban total rides make up over 68% of the total rides.  There were 1625 Urban rides, 625 Suburban rides, and only 125 Rural rides.  Given this information, it makes sense to see that the Urban areas also have the largest amount of drivers compared to the other 2 city types.  The total drivers in Urban areas are 2405, Suburban 490, and Rural drivers had 78 drivers.  Considering those results, we know that the total fares will end up with the same results.  Urban areas had the largest fare total with $39, 854.38.  This is almost $20,000 more than the next in line which is the Suburban area with a total fare of $19356.33.  The Rural area had a total fare of only $4327.93. 


The interesting thing about the total fares for the Urban areas being so much larger, is that the average total fare per ride ended up being the smallest of all the areas.  Rural areas had the largest average fare amount with the average fare being $34.62 per ride.  The Suburban areas were next with an average fare of $30.97.  The Urban areas had the lowest average fare with $24.53 per ride.  This information shows me that clearly the Urban areas had the largest amount of rides, and highest total fare amount, but that each ride had the smallest average fare. Since Rural areas had the largest average fare amount, that means that the rides were much longer than the Urban rides causing them to be much more expensive.  This data also shows that Rural areas have less activity, which could be assumed since there is a smaller population in Rural areas.  All in all, the total fares by city type end up being similar, but obviously total fares are largest in the larger populate areas, and mallest in the smaller populated areas.
